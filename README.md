# Odoo17 Code Vector Database

## Project Description

The **Odoo17 Code Vector Database** project aims to store the Odoo 17 codebase in a vector database enriched with comprehensive structural information and metadata. This initiative will enhance searchability, contextual understanding, and analytical capabilities, enabling efficient retrieval and analysis of code segments.

**Objectives:**

- **Semantic Search:** Enable code searches based on meaning and context rather than just keywords.
- **Impact Analysis:** Understand the implications of code changes across the entire codebase.
- **Refactoring Support:** Identify duplicate code or patterns that require optimization.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Facilitate onboarding and knowledge transfer within development teams.
- **Automated Documentation:** Generate documentation from enriched code metadata.

**Key Features:**

- **Comprehensive Metadata Storage:** Store detailed structural information such as classes, functions, variables, and dependencies.
- **Vector Embeddings:** Use state-of-the-art models to create vector representations of code for similarity searches.
- **Efficient Retrieval Mechanisms:** Implement indexing and optimization strategies for fast and relevant search results.
- **API Development:** Provide APIs for seamless integration with other tools and platforms.
- **User Interface:** Optional development of a user-friendly interface for interacting with the vector database.
